	<p>Gysin is a take on <a href="http://briongysin.com/">Brion Gysin's</a>
	<a href="http://briongysin.com/?category_name=cut-up">"cut-up"</a>
	technique: a
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism">Surrealist</a> method for
	creating interesting new combinations of words and images by simply cutting 
	paper into strips and re-arranging them until something popped out and
	spanked one's limbic system.</p>

	<p>This <a href="/editor">editor</a> uses 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">
		Markov Chains</a> on a small database of pop-song lyrics (or epic poems,
	or fairy tales, it'll change from time to time) to get a similar effect. It
	is roumored that 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Jones">Duncan Jones</a> (n√©e 
	Zowie Bowie) once wrote a similar program for 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1InCrzGIPU">David Bowie</a>, but
	I've not been able to find any examples.  Messrs. Jones are welcome to beat 
	me with a gunny-sack full of Sinclair ZX81s, for horking their idea, but 
	I'm sure they are used to it by now.</p>

	<p>This is not an "automatic songwriter" or any sort of artificial 
	intelligence tool. Most of what comes out will be disjointed drivel.
	It's a fun toy that may help you with ideas, or maybe help you through
	a bit of writer's block. Using the output of this editor to produce actual
	pop music will probably not be noticed. It's definitely what
	George Clinton was warning us about.</p>

	<p>Have fun!</p>
